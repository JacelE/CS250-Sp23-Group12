# Mountain Lion Detection System

## Overview
The Mountain Lion Detection System will be a system that will help detect and alarm park rangers 
of any animal noises within the park. In order to achieve this there will be an amount of classes, 
and methods within the classes, to attend to any specific alarm/alert scenario. This program is 
specifically meant to detect mountain lions hence will focus a lot on the detection of any specific 
sounds/noises of animals. Therefore, the sensors would be programmed to detect animal noises. This 
software will start with designing the Pop-Up Alert which will be called if any noises are to be 
picked up and that will be covered with a class called Alarm. That class will be the basis of 
capturing any sort of alarms throughout the park and will determine if the noise captured is an 
actual mountain lion. That class will therefore have a check system to see if the noise captured 
is a mountain lion. Another class will be constructed to notify the park rangers and have another 
to note the dates of every alarm. Another class will pinpoint the actual location and display that 
to the user. Finally, in order to access the alarm system the park rangers must login to therefore 
turn off the alarm once triggered and access the location of such alarm.
