Overview
The Mountain Lion Detection System will be a system that will help detect and alarm park rangers of any animal noises within the park. In order to achieve this there will be an amount of classes, and methods within the classes, to attend to any specific alarm/alert scenario. This program is specifically meant to detect mountain lions hence will focus a lot on the detection of any specific sounds/noises of animals. Therefore, the sensors would be programmed to detect animal noises. This software will start with designing the Pop-Up Alert which will be called if any noises are to be picked up and that will be covered with a class called Alarm. That class will be the basis of capturing any sort of alarms throughout the park and will determine if the noise captured is an actual mountain lion. That class will therefore have a check system to see if the noise captured is a mountain lion. Another class will be constructed to notify the park rangers and have another to note the dates of every alarm. Another class will pinpoint the actual location and display that to the user. Finally, in order to access the alarm system the park rangers must login to therefore turn off the alarm once triggered and access the location of such alarm.

Description of architectural diagram:
The Animal-R-Here sensors will detect sounds of animals and generate an alert to the park ranger terminal. From here 
the software will sound an audio alarm to get the attention of park rangers, then pull information from the California 
Park Database in order to creating a report detailing the sound type detected, location of the noise, and the date when 
it was detected. Afterwards the report will be stored in the database for future reference. When a park ranger logs on 
in order to disable the alarm and check the report, the system will match their credentials against the park ranger database
before allowing them to access a map api showing the report and the location of the detection.


Description of classes:
-UserRanger
This class is designed to have individual rangers input their login credentials and validate it, in order to login to the system.
-ControlSystem
This class is meant to design the specific alarm that will be set whenever an animal is detected and logout when necessary.
-AlarmSystem
This class is designed to create the alarm when it has been set off and determines what type of alarm it would be based on the animal detected. 
-Alarm
This class is designed to send all attributes of the given alarm to the alarm system to determine which alarm to set off / which animal has been detected and the location of such alert.
-ParkControl
This class is designed to notify the security/rangers and to do the necessary steps when an alarm is called.
-MapSystem
This class is the source of the map and can determine where the sound was detected and return such location through its sensors.
-Report
The Report class works as a live After-Action Report on the situation that triggered the alarm; it is used to show the user what is going on, on what sound was played, to when it happened, to the location, etc. 
-Animal-R-Here
This class is the main sensor/trigger for sounds regarding the animals. It can determine where the alarm was triggered and send what type of sound it was.
